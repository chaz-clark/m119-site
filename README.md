# Canvas Course Toolkit

A Python toolkit for managing Canvas LMS courses as code. Mirror course content locally, sync across multiple courses (source → master → blueprint), audit structure, and manage quiz questions — all via the Canvas REST API.

Built for BYU-Idaho instructors. Works with any Canvas institution.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Install**
```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd <repo>
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
```

**2. Add your credentials to `.env`**
```
CANVAS_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
CANVAS_BASE_URL=https://your-institution.instructure.com
CANVAS_COURSE_ID=123456
```

- **Course ID:** open your Canvas course — it's the number in the URL after `/courses/`
- **API token:** Canvas → Account → Settings → Approved Integrations → New Access Token (requires instructor or admin role)

**3. Pull your course**
```bash
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --init
```

This mirrors your entire Canvas course into a local `course/` folder — all modules, pages, assignments, quizzes, discussions, and the syllabus.

**4. Check what you have**
```bash
ls course/                           # one folder per module
uv run python tools/course_quality_check.py   # audit for issues
```

**5. Edit locally, push to Canvas**
```bash
# Edit any file in course/ with a text editor
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --status  # see what changed
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --push    # push changes to Canvas
```

That's the core loop. Everything else builds on it.

## What it does

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `canvas_sync.py` | Mirror a Canvas course into a local `course/` folder. Pull, edit, push. |
| `blueprint_sync.py` | One-way sync from master → Blueprint course (for semester rollouts) |
| `course_mirror.py` | One-off mirror between any two courses by title-matching |
| `course_quality_check.py` | Audit any course for duplicates, floating published items, empty modules, and date issues |
| `canvas_quiz_questions.py` | Manage classic Canvas quiz questions from a local JSON file |
| `canvas_api_tool.py` | Cognitive load + Hattie 3-phase course auditor |

**Source of truth: your local `course/` folder.** Canvas is the delivery target.

---

## Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd <repo>
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
```

**`.env` variables:**
```
CANVAS_API_TOKEN=your_token
CANVAS_BASE_URL=https://byui.instructure.com
CANVAS_COURSE_ID=123456          # your working/source course
MASTER_COURSE_ID=123457          # master template course (optional)
BLUEPRINT_COURSE_ID=123458       # Canvas Blueprint course (optional)
```

**Find your course ID:** open your Canvas course — it's the number in the URL after `/courses/`.

**Generate an API token:** Canvas → Account → Settings → Approved Integrations → New Access Token. Requires instructor or admin role.

---

## Three-Course Architecture (optional)

For courses that use Canvas Blueprints for semester rollout:

```
Source (CANVAS_COURSE_ID)   ← you edit this; course/ mirrors it
       ↓ course_mirror.py
Master (MASTER_COURSE_ID)   ← clean template
       ↓ blueprint_sync.py
Blueprint (BLUEPRINT_COURSE_ID) ← Canvas clones new sections from this
```

If you only have one course, just use `canvas_sync.py` and ignore the rest.

---

## canvas_sync.py — course mirror

```bash
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --pull            # pull full course into course/
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --pull --quiet    # same, suppress per-file output
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --status          # show local changes not yet pushed
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --push            # push all local changes to Canvas
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --push "sprint-1" # push one module only
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --push syllabus   # push syllabus only
```

**Sync order:** always `--status` before `--push`. Don't push without knowing what changed.

### What gets pulled

| Type | Format | Editable |
|------|--------|----------|
| Pages | `.html` — body only | Yes |
| Assignments | `.json` — description, points, due date | Yes |
| Discussions | `.json` — title, body | Yes |
| Quizzes | `.json` — description, metadata | Yes |
| ExternalTool / SubHeader / ExternalUrl | `.json` — metadata only | No — manage in Canvas UI |

**Not pulled:** gradebook, submissions, student data.

---

## blueprint_sync.py — master → blueprint

```bash
uv run python tools/blueprint_sync.py --pull     # mirror blueprint into blueprint_course/ + build mapping
uv run python tools/blueprint_sync.py --status   # show mapping + date coverage
uv run python tools/blueprint_sync.py --push     # sync master content + dates → blueprint
```

Syncs: settings, homepage, syllabus, all mapped pages/assignments/quizzes/discussions (with dates), module published state, item completion requirements, sprint prerequisite chain.

**Does not sync:** NewQuiz/ExternalTool content (Canvas REST API limitation — manage these in Canvas UI).

---

## course_quality_check.py — course auditor

Checks any course for issues that cause student problems:

```bash
uv run python tools/course_quality_check.py              # check source course
uv run python tools/course_quality_check.py --master     # check master
uv run python tools/course_quality_check.py --blueprint  # check blueprint
uv run python tools/course_quality_check.py --all        # all three → quality_report.md
uv run python tools/course_quality_check.py --all --fix  # auto-fix duplicates
```

**What it checks:**
- Duplicate assignment groups, assignments, quizzes, module items
- Published items not linked in any module (students cannot find these)
- Empty modules (sync artifact when all items are NewQuiz/ExternalTool)
- Due/lock/unlock dates outside the course date window

**Report:** `quality_report.md` at repo root (gitignored — regenerate on demand).

---

## canvas_quiz_questions.py — quiz questions

Manages questions for classic Canvas quizzes (not NewQuiz) from a local JSON file:

```bash
uv run python tools/canvas_quiz_questions.py --push course/.../quiz.questions.json  # idempotent
uv run python tools/canvas_quiz_questions.py --list course/.../quiz.questions.json  # read-only
uv run python tools/canvas_quiz_questions.py --clear course/.../quiz.questions.json # delete all
```

**Question file format** (`*.questions.json`):
```json
{
  "canvas_quiz_id": 5911959,
  "course_id": "415322",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question_name": "Short label",
      "question_text": "Full question shown to student.",
      "question_type": "multiple_choice_question",
      "points_possible": 1,
      "answers": [
        {"answer_text": "Correct answer", "answer_weight": 100},
        {"answer_text": "Wrong answer",   "answer_weight": 0}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported types: `multiple_choice_question`, `true_false_question`, `short_answer_question`, `multiple_answers_question`, `essay_question`.

Note: `canvas_quiz_id` and `course_id` are course-specific — the same quiz has different IDs in each course. Push to each course separately.

---

## canvas_api_tool.py — structural auditor

```bash
uv run python tools/canvas_api_tool.py --test    # smoke tests, no credentials needed
```

Scores your course 0–100 across three frameworks:

**Cognitive Load** (extraneous / intrinsic / germane) — flags unclear navigation, inconsistent naming, buried content.

**Hattie's 3-Phase Model** — Surface (foundational knowledge), Deep (connecting ideas), Transfer (applying to new contexts). Gaps at Surface block everything downstream.

**Toyota Gap Analysis** — Current State → Target State → Gap → Root Cause → Countermeasure → Verification.

---

## Canvas API Gotchas

- **Module prerequisites** — use form-encoded `data={"module[prerequisite_module_ids][]": id}`, not JSON. JSON returns 200 but silently does nothing.
- **Completion requirements** — must be set on every item in a module for the prerequisite lock to enforce. `must_submit` for assignments/quizzes, `must_view` for pages/tools/URLs.
- **Classic quiz points** — Canvas may show 0 after questions are pushed. Fix with `PUT /quizzes/:id {"quiz": {"points_possible": N}}`.
- **late_policy PATCH** — returns 403 for instructor tokens. Set manually in Canvas Settings → Gradebook, or use admin token.
- **IDs are course-specific** — the same assignment has a different ID in every course and every cloned section. Always match content across courses by title, never by ID.
- **Content + module = two steps** — creating an assignment/quiz/page makes it exist in the course but students cannot access it until it is also added as a module item.

---

## BYUI Course Design Conventions

Each student-facing module follows this order:

1. **Overview page** — learning outcomes, estimated time, how items connect
2. **Content** — readings, videos, demos
3. **Teach One Another** — discussion where students explain or apply to peers
4. **Prove It** — assignment, quiz, or milestone demonstrating mastery

Module naming: `Sprint X: Topic (WXX–WXX)` or `Week X: Topic`.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`--pull` returns empty modules** — verify `CANVAS_COURSE_ID` is correct and the token has instructor access. Test: `GET /api/v1/courses/:id` — response should show `"type": "teacher"` in enrollments.

**Push returns 403** — token is read-only or student-level. Generate a new token from an instructor or admin account.

**`--status` shows everything changed after `--pull`** — index hashes may not have been written. Re-run `--pull` (safe to re-run).

**Page looks wrong in Canvas after push** — Canvas adds its own CSS wrapper. The `.html` files store body only. Check in Student View, not the editor.

**Quality check shows "published not in module"** — the item exists in the course but was never linked to a module. Add it via Canvas UI or `POST /modules/:id/items`.
