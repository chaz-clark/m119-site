## The Three Phases

John Hattie's research identifies three phases every learner must move through. A well-designed course scaffolds all three in sequence. A gap in an earlier phase blocks progression to the next.

**Phase 1 → Surface → Phase 2 → Deep → Phase 3 → Transfer**

A course cannot support Deep learning if the Surface is broken. A course cannot support Transfer if Deep is absent.

---

## Phase 1: Surface Learning

Students acquire foundational knowledge — the "what" and "how." They need clear navigation, sequenced content, and low extraneous load so they can focus on new information rather than figuring out where to go.

### Canvas indicators Surface is supported

- Module has an overview page (outcomes, time estimate, sequence of items)
- Content items are clearly labeled and logically ordered
- Navigation is predictable — consistent module naming, no orphaned pages
- Item count is manageable (≤7 per module)
- All items in a published module are also published (no broken links)

### Canvas indicators of a Surface gap

| Signal | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| No overview page | Students don't know what they're learning or why before they start |
| Module starts with an assessment | Students are tested before they've been taught |
| Inconsistent module naming | Navigation is unpredictable; students can't build a mental map of the course |
| Unpublished items in a live module | Students hit dead ends — orientation collapses |
| >7 items in a module | Cognitive overload before content learning begins |
| Duplicate instructions | Students waste working memory resolving contradictions |

### Cognitive load connection

Surface gaps are almost always **extraneous load** — friction caused by poor design, not content complexity. Extraneous load competes directly with intrinsic load (the actual difficulty of the material). Fix extraneous load first.

---

## Phase 2: Deep Learning

Students connect ideas, find patterns, and build understanding — the "why" and "when." They need activities that require them to explain, compare, debate, or teach. Surface knowledge is the raw material; Deep learning is where it becomes understanding.

### Canvas indicators Deep is supported

- Discussion activities where students apply or explain concepts to each other (BYUI: Teach One Another)
- Assignments that require synthesis, comparison, or judgment — not just recall
- Learning outcomes explicitly stated on overview pages (students need to know *what* to connect)
- Peer review or collaborative tasks
- Reflection prompts tied to content

### Canvas indicators of a Deep gap

| Signal | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| Module has only quizzes and readings | No mechanism for students to construct meaning |
| All assessments are multiple-choice | Recall is tested, not understanding |
| No discussion or peer interaction | Students process individually only — no social construction of knowledge |
| Overview page exists but states no outcomes | Students can't connect new content to goals they understand |

### Cognitive load connection

Deep learning gaps often involve **germane load** — the productive cognitive work of building schema. Germane load is good; the design problem is when it's absent. A module with no synthesis activity has no germane load — students memorize but don't understand.

---

## Phase 3: Transfer Learning

Students apply knowledge to new, unfamiliar contexts — the "what if" and "so what." Transfer is the goal of education. It requires authentic tasks with real-world stakes or cross-domain application, where students must make judgment calls rather than follow a procedure.

### Canvas indicators Transfer is supported

- Project-based or milestone assessments with open-ended scope
- Self-assessment or reflection assignments
- Assignments that require applying skills to problems the course hasn't explicitly modeled
- Capstone tasks that integrate multiple modules
- Students make design or judgment decisions (not just execute a known procedure)

### Canvas indicators of a Transfer gap

| Signal | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| No project or milestone assignment | Students never have to apply knowledge independently |
| All assessments are closed (structured lab with answer key, quiz) | Every problem has a right answer — no transfer required |
| No self-assessment or end-of-unit reflection | Students never evaluate their own understanding |
| Module ends immediately after a quiz | No consolidation or application after assessment |

### Cognitive load connection

Transfer requires **reduced extraneous load** and **sufficient germane load** — students can't transfer if they're still fighting navigation friction, and they can't transfer if they never built schema in the Deep phase. Transfer gaps are often symptoms of Surface or Deep gaps upstream.

## Phase Gap Tags Used in Audit Output

Every audit issue includes a `hattie_phase` field:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `surface` | Issue blocks foundational acquisition |
| `deep` | Issue prevents connection and understanding |
| `transfer` | Issue removes authentic application opportunity |
| `all` | Issue impairs the entire learning progression |

Prioritize fixing issues tagged `all` first (e.g., missing overview, broken module navigation), then `surface`, then `deep`, then `transfer`.

## Mapping to BYUI Module Structure

| BYUI Element | Hattie Phase |
|---|---|
| Overview page | Surface — orients and reduces extraneous load |
| Content (readings, videos, demos) | Surface — foundational acquisition |
| NotebookLM / AI tools | Surface → Deep — acquisition + elaboration |
| Teach One Another (discussion) | Deep — peer construction of meaning |
| Stand Up Report / quiz | Deep → Transfer — checking understanding, beginning application |
| Prove It (assignment, milestone) | Transfer — authentic demonstration |
| Self-assessment / reflection | Transfer — metacognitive consolidation |
