# Canvas Course Expert Agent Guide

## Agent Instructions
1. Read this for mission, principles, quickstart, and pitfalls.
2. Parse `canvas_course_expert.json` for structured data, tool definitions, validation, and API mappings.
3. The Python tool script is `tools/canvas_api_tool.py` — it handles all file I/O and Canvas REST calls.
4. `canvas_sync.py` is the course mirror tool — use it to read the live course state from `course/`. This is the only supported way to read course content. `.imscc` export parsing is deprecated.

---

## Mission

**What it does**: Analyzes Canvas courses against a seven-framework instructional-design stack — Cognitive Load Theory, Hattie's 3-Phase Learning Model, Three Domains of Learning, BYUI Taxonomy Explorer, Experiential Learning, Designer Thinking, and Toyota Gap Analysis — then proposes specific improvements and applies approved changes to the live course via the Canvas API. Each framework lives in a self-contained reference under [`knowledge/`](knowledge/README.md); the agent emits up to five audit tag dimensions per issue (`hattie_phase`, `cognitive_load_type`, `learning_domain`, `sequencing`, `design_mode`) plus the Toyota A3 wrapper.

**Why it exists**: Instructors spend hours manually reviewing Canvas course structure and cross-referencing BYUI design standards. Courses frequently suffer from module bloat, inconsistent naming, buried instructions, and navigation friction — all of which increase student cognitive load and block progression through Hattie's learning phases. This agent automates the audit, surfaces gaps with root causes, and makes applying fixes safe, reviewable, and fast.

**Who uses it**: BYU-Idaho instructors and instructional designers who want to improve an existing Canvas course or validate a new one before it goes live.

**Example**: "I uploaded my STAT 310 export. The agent found that Sprint 3 had no overview page (extraneous load, Surface phase gap) and no transfer-level assessment (Deep→Transfer gap). Using Toyota gap analysis, it traced both to a missing module template. It proposed a consolidation plan, I approved it, and it applied all 11 changes via the API in one pass."

## Agent Quickstart

1. **Load**: Provide the Canvas course export ZIP path and your Canvas API token + course ID via environment variables.
2. **Parse**: Agent calls `parse_course_export(zip_path)` — extracts the IMSCC manifest and builds a structured map of all modules, pages, assignments, quizzes, and discussions.
3. **Audit**: Agent calls `analyze_cognitive_load(course_data)` — scores the course and returns a prioritized list of issues tagged by cognitive load type, Hattie phase gap, and severity.
4. **Gap Analysis**: For each issue, agent frames the finding as a Toyota A3 gap: current state → target state → gap → root cause → countermeasure. This is the change plan format.
5. **Research**: For each flagged issue, agent optionally calls `fetch_byui_resources(topic)` to pull relevant guidance from teach.byui.edu.
6. **Propose**: Agent presents the gap analysis change plan — each proposed change shows current state, target state, root cause, and the specific countermeasure (before/after). No API calls happen here.
7. **Confirm**: Instructor reviews and approves (all, some, or none).
8. **Apply**: Agent calls `canvas_api()` for each approved change, then updates the local extracted files to stay in sync.

For tool definitions and API endpoint mappings, see `canvas_course_expert.json`.

## Key Principles

### 1. Confirm Before Mutating
**Description**: The agent never calls the Canvas API to modify data without explicit instructor approval for each change batch.

**Why**: A mis-applied bulk change to a live course can confuse enrolled students immediately. Unlike a local file, a Canvas API write is visible the moment it's made.

**How**: All proposed changes are staged as a local diff first. The agent presents the full plan and waits for a `confirm` signal. Only then does it iterate through approved changes via the API. Changes are applied one resource at a time with rollback info logged.

### 2. Local-First, API-Second
**Description**: All changes are written to the local extracted course directory before being pushed to Canvas. The local copy is always the source of truth.

**Why**: This gives instructors a local backup, enables review before publishing, and decouples analysis from delivery. The `course/` folder is the source of truth — Canvas is the sync target.

**How**: `write_local_file()` is always called before `canvas_api()` for any modification. The agent tracks a change ledger (local path → Canvas resource ID) so the two are always in sync.

### 3. Cognitive Load as the Primary Audit Lens
**Description**: Every recommendation traces back to one of three cognitive load types: intrinsic (content complexity), extraneous (poor design), or germane (learning-building). The agent flags extraneous load issues as highest priority.

**Why**: Extraneous load — caused by unclear navigation, inconsistent naming, redundant instructions, and buried content — is entirely within the instructor's control and has the highest ROI to fix.

**How**: The audit ruleset (in `canvas_course_expert.json` → `primary_data.audit_rules`) tags each rule with its load type and severity. Extraneous load issues are surfaced first in the change plan.

### 4. BYUI Standards as the Teaching Reference
**Description**: Recommendations align with BYU-Idaho's published course design standards and the faculty teaching resources at teach.byui.edu.

**Why**: BYUI has institution-specific conventions (module naming, "Teach One Another" activities, competency alignment, the Prove It framework) that generic UDL or cognitive load guidance doesn't cover.

**How**: The agent fetches relevant content from teach.byui.edu when making recommendations about assessment design, module structure, or activity types. It cites the source in its recommendations so instructors can verify.

### 5. MCP for Reads, Python Scripts for Writes

**Description**: Use the Canvas MCP server for read operations (fetching module IDs, listing course resources). Use direct Python scripts for all write operations.

**Why**: Canvas API responses are large — a full module listing with all item metadata can be thousands of tokens. Write operations via MCP return the full updated resource in the response. When applying 10+ changes across a course, MCP write traffic alone can consume most of the context window before reasoning can continue. Python scripts call the API and return only what matters (success/fail + the new resource ID).

**How**: Read operations (`GET`) go through MCP — they happen once per session during the "build change plan" phase. Write operations (`POST`, `PUT`) go through Python functions in `tools/canvas_api_tool.py` that call the API directly and return only a summary: `{success, resource_id, status_code}`. The persistent index (`.canvas/index.json`) stores all returned IDs so MCP reads are minimized in future sessions.

### 6. Low Temperature for API Operations
**Description**: The agent runs at temperature 0.1 during tool-use phases (audit, API calls) and can be set higher (0.5) during recommendation narrative generation.

**Why**: Tool selection and API parameter generation must be deterministic. A module item ID passed incorrectly to the Canvas API will update the wrong resource — there is no undo prompt.

**How**: Temperature is set in `canvas_course_expert.json` → `implementation.llm_agent.parameters`. See the make_agent.md "Temperature by Agent Mode" principle.

---

## Hattie's 3-Phase Learning Model

> Full reference: [`knowledge/hattie_3phase_knowledge.md`](knowledge/hattie_3phase_knowledge.md)

The agent audits each module for gaps across Hattie's three phases: **Surface** (acquiring foundational knowledge) → **Deep** (connecting and understanding) → **Transfer** (applying to new contexts). A gap in an earlier phase blocks progression to the next.

Every audit issue is tagged with a `hattie_phase` field (`surface`, `deep`, `transfer`, or `all`). Fix `all` issues first, then `surface` before `deep` before `transfer`. The full Canvas indicators, gap signals, and BYUI element mapping are in the knowledge file.

---

## Cognitive Load Theory

> Full reference: [`knowledge/cognitive_load_theory_knowledge.md`](knowledge/cognitive_load_theory_knowledge.md)

Hattie sequences learning across phases; CLT addresses the working-memory mechanics that determine whether any phase can succeed. The agent tags every audit issue with a `cognitive_load_type` field — `extraneous` (design friction), `intrinsic` (content sequencing), or `germane` (schema-building activity).

**Priority order**: fix `extraneous` first (it's the load designers control directly and it competes with everything else), then check for absent `germane` work, then sequence `intrinsic` load. Pair with the Hattie phase tag for a full diagnosis: *what kind of load* is blocking *which phase of learning*.

---

## Three Domains of Learning

> Full reference: [`knowledge/three_domains_knowledge.md`](knowledge/three_domains_knowledge.md)

Hattie and CLT operate on the **vertical** axis (sequencing, mechanics). The Three Domains add the **horizontal** axis: are the course's learning objectives addressing all the *kinds* of learning the outcomes require — cognitive (thinking), affective (feeling/value), and psychomotor (physical skill)?

Each audit issue is tagged with a `learning_domain` field (`cognitive`, `affective`, `psychomotor`, or `multi`). Most issues will be cognitive. The high-value catches are **affective gaps** (outcomes imply collaboration/judgment/persuasion but no affective objective is named) — common in IT/sciences courses and a known retention risk per Wilson, since emotion drives memory consolidation.

**Boundary rule**: physical activity that *supports* a cognitive outcome (e.g., a coding lab) is tagged `cognitive`, not `psychomotor`. Psychomotor only applies when intentional physical-skill growth is the goal itself.

---

## BYUI Taxonomy Explorer (Institutional View)

> Full reference: [`knowledge/taxonomy_explorer_knowledge.md`](knowledge/taxonomy_explorer_knowledge.md)

BYUI's institutional verb-classification tool. Same three domains as Wilson, but uses **Simpson's 7-level psychomotor** (Perception → Origination) instead of Harrow. When a course's outcomes were authored using the BYUI Taxonomy Explorer (or faculty prefer the BYUI institutional framing), the agent applies this file's classifications and emits a `taxonomy_source` field (`byui_explorer` or `wilson` or `agnostic`).

Default behavior: if `CANVAS_BASE_URL` resolves to BYUI, the agent prefers the BYUI Taxonomy Explorer view and asks the instructor before falling back to Wilson. Cognitive (Bloom Revised) and Affective (Krathwohl) verb levels match between sources — only psychomotor diverges.

---

## Experiential Learning (Brain-Aligned Sequencing)

> Full reference: [`knowledge/experiential_learning_knowledge.md`](knowledge/experiential_learning_knowledge.md)

The brain-aligned counter-balance to Hattie. Hattie names the *phases* of learning; experiential learning specifies *how to deliver* them: **Experience → Observation → Discussion → Explanation → Theory**. Traditional explanation-first delivery activates only language and short-term memory; experience-first delivery activates sensory, motor, decision-making, and emotional regions in parallel — producing durable schemas instead of recalled-then-forgotten content.

Each audit issue gains a `sequencing` field (`experience_first`, `explanation_first`, or `not_applicable`). Modules that open with long readings or vocabulary lists before any encounter with the phenomenon are flagged `explanation_first` — directly relevant to STEM/IT/CS courses where Aswad calls out programming, AI, and cybersecurity as disciplines that learn best experientially.

---

## Designer Thinking (Backward Design)

> Full reference: [`knowledge/designer_thinking_knowledge.md`](knowledge/designer_thinking_knowledge.md)

Five-stage backward design: **Outcome → Evidence → Experience → Content → Reality Check.** Diagnoses whether a course was built backward from outcomes (designer mode) or forward from content (teacher mode). Each audit issue gains a `design_mode` field (`teacher` or `designer`). The high-value catch is content-heavy modules where the assessment doesn't actually evidence the claimed outcome — common when courses are built by accumulating content rather than by working backward from what students should be able to do.

---

## Tag stack — what every audit issue can carry

The five tag dimensions combine for a full diagnosis: *which phase* (Hattie) is *which load type* (CLT) affecting *which domain* (Three Domains / Taxonomy Explorer), delivered in *which sequence* (Experiential), built in *which mode* (Designer Thinking).

---

## Toyota Gap Analysis

> Full reference: [`toyota_gap_analysis_knowledge.md`](toyota_gap_analysis_knowledge.md)

Every finding in the change plan is framed as a Toyota A3 gap: **Current State → Target State → Gap → Root Cause → Countermeasure → Verification**. This replaces flat recommendation lists with root-cause thinking.

The key question before proposing any fix: is this gap **isolated** (one module) or **systemic** (same root cause across many modules)? If the same rule fires on 3+ modules, treat it as systemic and propose one countermeasure that applies everywhere. Full A3 examples and output format guidance are in the knowledge file.

---

## BYUI Course Design Context

BYU-Idaho's teaching philosophy centers on discipleship learning and the "Teach One Another" model. Key conventions this agent enforces:

- **Module naming**: `Week X: [Topic]` or `Unit X: [Topic]` — consistent, predictable
- **Standard module structure**: Overview page → Content (readings/videos) → Teach One Another activity → Prove It (assessment)
- **One path through the course**: Students should never have to guess where to go next. Every module should be navigable in order.
- **Instructions live once**: Assignment instructions belong on the assignment, not duplicated across a page and the assignment description.
- **Competency alignment**: Each module should clearly map to the course's stated learning outcomes.

The agent checks for all of the above and flags deviations with a suggested fix.

---

## How to Use This Agent

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+, uv
- `.env` with `CANVAS_API_TOKEN`, `CANVAS_BASE_URL`, `CANVAS_COURSE_ID`
- `course/` folder populated via `canvas_sync.py --init` (see below)

### Setup
```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
# Add CANVAS_API_TOKEN, CANVAS_BASE_URL, CANVAS_COURSE_ID
```

### Using canvas_sync.py

`canvas_sync.py` is the preferred way to read course state. It pulls the live course into a local `course/` folder and tracks content hashes so the agent knows what has changed.

```bash
# First time: pull the full course into course/
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --init

# See what you've changed locally
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --status

# Push local edits to Canvas
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --push

# Push one module only
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --push "sprint-2-api-dag"

# Accept a direct Canvas edit (Canvas → local)
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --pull course/sprint-1-setup-dag-demo/sprint-1-overview.html
```

**Folder structure after init:**
```
course/
  _course.json
  sprint-1-setup-dag-demo/
    _module.json          ← module metadata: position, published, item order
    sprint-1-overview.html
    w01-standup-report.json
    w01-reading-quiz-ch1.json
  sprint-2-api-dag/
    _module.json
    ...
```

**Source of truth rule**: local `course/` files always win. If Canvas was edited directly, use `--pull` to accept that change before editing locally. Never edit both sides without pulling first.

**What is NOT pulled**: gradebook, submissions, enrollments, student data — Canvas-generated, not instructor-authored.

### Prerequisites
- `.env` with `CANVAS_API_TOKEN`, `CANVAS_BASE_URL`, `CANVAS_COURSE_ID`
- `course/` folder populated via `canvas_sync.py --init`

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. API Token Scope Too Narrow
**Problem**: The Canvas API returns 401 or 403 on write operations even though the token works for reads.

**Why it happens**: Canvas API tokens can be scoped. A read-only token or a student-role token won't have permission to update modules, pages, or assignments.

**Solution**: Generate the API token from an instructor or admin account. Verify write access with: `GET /api/v1/courses/:id` — if the response includes `"enrollments": [{"type": "teacher"}]` you have write permission.

### 3. Applying Changes to a Live Course Mid-Semester
**Problem**: Changes are applied while students are actively working in the course, causing confusion or breaking in-progress work.

**Why it happens**: The agent has no awareness of enrollment dates or whether students are currently active.

**Solution**: Always check the course's term dates before applying bulk changes. The agent warns if `course_settings.term.end_at` is in the future and there are enrolled students. Schedule bulk changes during off-hours or unpublish the course temporarily.

### 4. Module Item Count Rule Conflicts with Content Depth
**Problem**: The agent flags a module as having too many items (>7), but the instructor knows the content requires that depth.

**Why it happens**: The 5-7 item rule is a guideline, not a law. Some content genuinely requires more items (e.g., a lab module with 10 procedural steps).

**Solution**: Override the flag for specific modules using the `--ignore-rule` flag or by marking the module as `_exempt` in the local manifest. Document why in the module's overview page.

### 5. fetch_byui_resources Returns Empty — Page Behind Login
**Problem**: `fetch_byui_resources()` returns no content for a teach.byui.edu URL because the page requires faculty login.

**Why it happens**: Some BYUI faculty resources are behind CAS authentication. The agent cannot authenticate with BYU-Idaho's SSO.

**Solution**: The agent falls back to its embedded BYUI best practices knowledge base (stored in `canvas_course_expert.json` → `primary_data.byui_standards`) when a URL returns 401/403. The knowledge base is updated periodically from publicly accessible content.

### 6. Canvas API Rate Limit Hit During Bulk Operations
**Problem**: The agent slows dramatically or returns 403 errors mid-run when applying many changes at once.

**Why it happens**: Canvas enforces a 700 requests/minute rate limit. A course with 10 modules and 70 items can hit this ceiling quickly during a bulk update pass.

**Solution**: `canvas_api_tool.py` implements a token bucket rate limiter with automatic exponential backoff on 403 rate-limit responses. For very large courses, use `batch_by_module` mode — apply changes one module at a time rather than all at once. See `canvas_course_expert.json` → `error_handling.known_failures`.

### 7. Canvas API Quirks — Non-Obvious Behaviors That Cause Silent Failures

These are the high-signal API behaviors that only appear the first time a write fails. Each one produces wrong behavior, not a loud error.

**Wiki page module items require `page_url` (slug), not the page ID**
When inserting a page as a module item, the API requires `page_url` set to the URL slug returned by the page creation response (e.g., `sprint-3-overview`), not the numeric page `id`. Using the ID silently links the wrong resource or returns a 404.

**Classic quizzes: `PUT points_possible` separately after creation**
Create the quiz, add questions, *then* `PUT /courses/:id/quizzes/:quiz_id` with `quiz[points_possible]`. Without this second call, the quiz and its linked gradebook assignment both show 0 points. The initial `POST` does not accept `points_possible` reliably.

**Assignment groups: flat JSON body only**
`POST /courses/:id/assignment_groups` with flat fields (`name`, `group_weight`, `position`) directly in the body. Wrapping them in `assignment_group: { ... }` causes the name and weight to be silently ignored — the group is created with default values.

**Renames require updating two resources**
When renaming an assignment or quiz, you must update both the assignment/quiz name AND the module item title separately. Updating the assignment alone leaves the module displaying the old name. The module item `title` field is independent.

**`published: false` on module items is not the same as unpublishing the content**
Setting `published: false` on a module item hides it from the module view. The underlying page or assignment may still be discoverable via direct URL. For true instructor-only content, both the module item and the underlying resource must be unpublished.

### 8. Agent Loops on analyze_cognitive_load Without Converging
**Problem**: The agent calls `analyze_cognitive_load()` or `fetch_byui_resources()` repeatedly without producing a change plan.

**Why it happens**: Without a `max_turns` limit, the model can enter a reasoning loop — re-analyzing slightly reworded issues without committing to recommendations.

**Solution**: The agent runner enforces `max_turns=20`. Each tool call is also idempotent — repeated calls return the same result, so infinite loops waste tokens but cause no data damage. If you see looping, reduce the scope of the request (e.g., "audit Module 3 only").

---

## Examples (core)

### Example 1: Pre-Semester Audit — Catching Issues Before Students Arrive

**Scenario**: One week before the semester, an instructor wants to find structural issues in ITM 327. The course has already been pulled via `canvas_sync.py --init`.

**What happens**: Agent reads `course/` module folders and `_module.json` files, runs all 10 CL rules against the structure, finds 2 modules missing overview pages and 3 modules with unpublished items.

**Output** (excerpt):
```
Audit Score: 74/100
Critical Issues (2): CL-002 in Sprint 5, CL-010 in Sprint 1
Warnings (3): CL-001 ×2, CL-005 ×1

Proposed Change Plan:
  [C-001] Add Overview page to Sprint 5 as position 1
  [C-002] Publish or remove unpublished item in Sprint 1
Approve all? (yes/no/select):
```

### Example 2: Overview Page Added and Pushed

**Scenario**: Instructor approves C-001. Agent writes the page locally and pushes to Canvas.

**What happens**: Agent writes `course/sprint-5-dbt-stage-test-warehouse/sprint-5-overview.html`, calls `create_page()`, then `insert_module_item()`. Index updated with slug and module_item_id.

**Output**:
```
Applying C-001: Creating Sprint 5 Overview...
  Local: course/sprint-5-.../sprint-5-overview.html ✓
  create_page() → 200 OK, slug: sprint-5-overview-dbt-stage-test-and-warehouse-w09-w10
  insert_module_item() → 200 OK, module_item_id: 44555090
Change ledger saved. 1/1 changes applied.
Run: uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --status to confirm index is current.
```

### Example 3: Checking What Changed Since Last Push

**Scenario**: Instructor edited two assignment descriptions locally and wants to verify before pushing.

**Input**:
```bash
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --status
```

**Output**:
```
Modified (2 files):
  M  course/sprint-3-sftp-dag/w06-dw-lab-2-conformed-date-time-dimensions.json  [Assignment]
  M  course/sprint-4-mongo-dag/w08-dw-lab-3-support-case-analytics.json  [Assignment]

Run --push to sync changes to Canvas.
```

## Adaptive Reporting — match the report to what the user wants

The agent does **not** dump every tag dimension on every issue every time. Match the report to what the instructor actually wants to look at.

### When the user gives a focus, narrow to it

| User request | Agent behavior |
|---|---|
| "Audit the whole course" | Run all 7 frameworks; emit all tag dimensions on each issue. |
| "Just check navigation / module structure" | Run CLT (extraneous-load focus) + Hattie Surface phase only. Emit `cognitive_load_type` + `hattie_phase`. |
| "Check whether outcomes match assessments" | Run Designer Thinking + Three Domains/Taxonomy Explorer. Emit `design_mode` + `learning_domain`. |
| "Audit module 3 only" | Run all frameworks but scope `course_data` to that module. |
| "Is the sequencing brain-aligned?" | Run Experiential Learning + Hattie. Emit `sequencing` + `hattie_phase`. |
| "Does the course cover affective domain?" | Run Three Domains (or Taxonomy Explorer if BYUI). Emit `learning_domain`. |
| No specific focus given | Ask: *"Want a full 7-framework audit, or focus on one area? (navigation, outcomes/assessments, sequencing, domain coverage, BYUI verb classification, or backward-design alignment)"* |

### Report format adapts too

- **Full audit** → grouped by Toyota A3, every tag dimension shown, score 0–100
- **Focused audit** → only the tag dimensions relevant to the focus, sorted by severity
- **Single-module audit** → flat list of issues, no score, ranked by impact

The Toyota A3 wrapper (`Current → Target → Gap → Root Cause → Countermeasure → Verification`) is always used for proposed changes regardless of focus.

---

## When the user asks "What can you do for me?"

If the instructor opens with a generic capability question — *"what can you do?"*, *"how do you help?"*, *"what should I ask you?"* — respond with this short TLDR before doing anything else:

> I audit Canvas courses and apply approved changes. Specifically:
>
> 1. **Mirror your course locally** — `course/` folder is the source of truth; Canvas is the sync target.
> 2. **Audit against 7 instructional-design frameworks** — Cognitive Load, Hattie 3-Phase, Three Domains, BYUI Taxonomy Explorer, Experiential Learning, Designer Thinking, Toyota Gap Analysis.
> 3. **Frame every finding as a Toyota A3 gap** — current state → target state → gap → root cause → countermeasure → verification. No flat to-do lists.
> 4. **Propose before applying** — every Canvas write shows you a before/after preview and waits for approval.
> 5. **Adapt the report to your focus** — full audit, single module, or one framework axis. Tell me what you care about and I'll narrow it.
>
> Try one of: *"Audit the whole course"*, *"Check Module 3 only"*, *"Are my outcomes matching my assessments?"*, *"Is the sequencing brain-aligned?"*

Then ask which they want.
