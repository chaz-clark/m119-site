# Agent Quality Control (QC) Guide

## Agent Instructions
1. Read this for mission, principles, quickstart, and pitfalls.
2. Parse `make_agent_qc.json` for structured data, validation checklists, and scoring criteria.
3. This QC agent validates newly created agents for quality, completeness, and adherence to make_agent standards.

---

## Mission (core)

A systematic quality control agent that validates newly created agents against the make_agent template standards.

**What it does**: Analyzes agent MD and JSON files to verify they meet quality standards, are topic-specific, and have removed unused optional sections.

**Why it exists**: Ensures consistency across agent implementations and prevents incomplete or poorly structured agents from being deployed.

**Who uses it**: Agent developers, team leads, and automated CI/CD pipelines performing agent validation.

**Example**: "Analyzes a new SQL validation agent, scores it across 8 quality dimensions, and provides actionable feedback for improvement."

---

## Agent Quickstart (core)

Fast-path workflow for validating an agent:

1. **[Identify]**: Locate the agent's .md and .json files
   - Example: "Find `sql_validator.md` and `sql_validator.json`"

2. **[Parse Structure]**: Load structured validation rules from `make_agent_qc.json`
   - Example: "Load tier requirements, core section checklist, optional section rules"

3. **[Validate]**: Run all quality checks across 8 dimensions
   - Example: "Check completeness, specificity, cleanup, consistency, examples, validation, dependencies, documentation"

4. **[Score]**: Calculate quality scores and identify issues
   - Example: "Generate 0-100 score per dimension with issue details"

5. **[Output]**: Produce validation report with pass/fail and improvement recommendations
   - Example: "Return structured report: 85/100 with 3 critical issues and 5 recommendations"

For detailed validation rules and scoring criteria, see `make_agent_qc.json`.

## File Organization: JSON vs MD (core)

### This Markdown File (.md) Contains:
- ✅ Mission and validation philosophy
- ✅ Quality principles that guide validation
- ✅ How to interpret validation results
- ✅ Common pitfalls in agent creation
- ✅ Educational context on why each check matters

### The JSON File (.json) Contains:
- ✅ Validation checklists (structured as arrays)
- ✅ Scoring rubrics with weights
- ✅ Pattern matching rules for detection
- ✅ Core vs optional section lists
- ✅ Specific test cases and validation methods
- ✅ Error taxonomy and severity levels

**Rule of Thumb**: Validation logic → JSON. Understanding "why" quality matters → MD.

## Key Principles (core)

### 1. Completeness Over Perfection
**Description**: All core sections must be present and filled; optional sections should only exist if needed.

**Why**: A minimally complete agent is better than an incomplete complex one. Core sections ensure basic functionality.

**How**: Check all tier_1_core sections exist with non-placeholder content. Verify optional sections are removed if unused.

### 2. Specificity Over Generics
**Description**: Agent content must be specific to its stated purpose, not filled with template placeholders.

**Why**: Generic agents provide no real value. "YourAgent" and "[Description]" indicate incomplete work.

**How**: Detect placeholder patterns, verify examples contain concrete code/data, ensure principles relate to the specific agent domain.

### 3. JSON-MD Separation
**Description**: Structured data belongs in JSON, narrative explanation in MD.

**Why**: Maintains parseability for automated systems while keeping human-readable context separate.

**How**: Verify JSON contains parseable structures (arrays, objects) and MD explains concepts without duplicating structured data.

### 4. Cleanup Discipline
**Description**: Unused sections must be removed, not left as empty placeholders.

**Why**: Bloat confuses users and suggests incomplete work. Clean agents are maintainable agents.

**How**: Detect optional sections marked as unused but still present. Flag sections with only template text.

### 5. Validation Testability
**Description**: Validation sections must contain actionable tests, not aspirational statements.

**Why**: Untestable agents cannot be verified. "Check if it works" is not a test case.

**How**: Ensure validation section includes specific inputs, expected outputs, and verification methods.

### 6. MD/JSON Companion Sync
**Description**: Every substantive entry in the JSON (known_failures, guardrails, best_practices) must have corresponding narrative coverage in the companion MD (a pitfall, principle, or guidance note). The two files are a pair — one without the other is incomplete.

**Why**: The JSON tells practitioners *what* exists; the MD tells them *why* it matters and how to use it. A guardrail entry in JSON with no MD explanation leaves practitioners with a field they can't interpret. A pitfall in MD referencing a JSON field that doesn't exist breaks trust in both files.

**How**: For each JSON array entry in the sections above, check that the MD has at least one section that covers the same concept — even in different words. Use QC rule 10 (MD/JSON Companion Sync) and the `consistency` dimension checks. Flag unmatched entries as medium issues.

### 7. Pitfalls vs. External System Lessons — Different Things
**Description**: Agent design mistakes belong in `## Common Pitfalls`. Non-obvious behaviors of external systems the agent operates on belong in `## External System Lessons`. Mixing them dilutes both.

**Why**: A pitfall describes something the agent builder did wrong and can fix. An external system lesson describes something the external system does that will surprise you regardless of how well the agent is built. They require different responses: pitfalls are fixed by changing the agent; external system lessons are handled by documenting them so the agent knows in advance.

**How**: When reviewing pitfalls, flag any entry that is actually describing external system behavior (API quirks, undocumented requirements, data format surprises) and recommend moving it to the External System Lessons section. An agent that interacts with no external systems has no External System Lessons section.

### 8. Optional Sections Must Earn Their Presence
**Description**: Every optional section — Domain Terms, Existing Tooling, External System Lessons, Quality Bar — must reflect real agent characteristics, not template-filling.

**Why**: An empty Domain Terms table or a Quality Bar with generic placeholder checklist items signals the creator filled in sections without thinking about whether they apply. This adds noise and reduces trust in the rest of the document.

**How**: Check that optional sections, when present, contain content specific to the agent's domain. Generic placeholder rows (`[TERM]`, `[script or file path]`) in optional sections are treated as incomplete, same as placeholders in core sections.

## How to Use This Agent (core)

### Prerequisites
- Agent files to validate (both .md and .json)
- Access to make_agent template for comparison
- Understanding of agent tier system (tier_1_core, tier_2_recommended, tier_3_optional)

### Basic Usage

**Step 1: Prepare Agent Files**
```bash
# Ensure both files exist in the same directory
ls my_agent.md my_agent.json
```

**Step 2: Load QC Agent**
```python
# Load QC configuration from JSON
from agent_qc import AgentQualityControl
qc = AgentQualityControl.from_config("make_agent_qc.json")
```

**Step 3: Run Validation**
```python
# Validate agent files
result = qc.validate_agent(
    md_path="my_agent.md",
    json_path="my_agent.json"
)
```

**Step 4: Review Results**
```python
# Check validation report
print(f"Overall Score: {result.overall_score}/100")
print(f"Critical Issues: {len(result.critical_issues)}")
print(f"Status: {result.status}")  # PASS, FAIL, or NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT

# Get recommendations
for recommendation in result.recommendations:
    print(f"- {recommendation}")
```

### Advanced Usage

**Automated CI/CD Integration**
```bash
# Run QC in CI pipeline
python agent_qc_cli.py --agent my_agent --strict --output report.json
exit_code=$?
# exit_code 0 = pass, 1 = fail, 2 = needs improvement
```

**Batch Validation**
```python
# Validate multiple agents
agents = ["sql_validator", "data_processor", "api_client"]
results = qc.validate_batch(agents)

# Generate summary report
summary = qc.generate_summary(results)
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions (core)

### 1. Leaving Optional Sections Empty

**Problem**: Creator marks optional sections as unused but doesn't remove them from JSON.

**Why it happens**: Confusion about whether to delete or set `"optional": true`. Template contains all sections, creator doesn't realize they should delete.

**Solution**: If a section is truly optional and unused, remove the entire section from JSON. Don't just set flags.

**Example**:
```json
// ❌ Wrong - leaving unused section
"common_patterns": {
  "_tier": "tier_3_optional",
  "optional": true,
  "patterns": []
}

// ✅ Correct - remove entirely
// (section not present in file)
```

### 2. Generic Placeholder Content

**Problem**: Agent passes basic structure checks but contains "[Your description here]" or "YourAgentName" placeholders.

**Why it happens**: Creator fills required fields but doesn't replace template content with specifics.

**Solution**: Search for bracket patterns `[...]`, generic names, and template phrases. Replace with actual agent-specific content.

**Example**:
```python
# ❌ Wrong - generic content
"description": "This agent processes data efficiently."
"example": "agent.process(input_data)"

# ✅ Correct - specific content
"description": "This agent validates SQL queries against PostgreSQL 14 syntax rules and security patterns."
"example": "validator.validate('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1', dialect='postgresql')"
```

### 3. JSON-MD Content Duplication

**Problem**: Same code examples or structured data appear in both JSON and MD files.

**Why it happens**: Creator doesn't understand the separation principle and copies content between files.

**Solution**: Code snippets and structured data go in JSON. Narrative explanation and "why" goes in MD. MD should reference JSON, not duplicate it.

**Example**:
```markdown
<!-- ❌ Wrong - duplicating JSON structure in MD -->
## API Endpoints
- /api/v1/process - Processes data
- /api/v2/validate - Validates input

<!-- ✅ Correct - referencing JSON -->
## API Endpoints
For the complete list of API endpoints with parameters and examples, see `my_agent.json` → `primary_data.endpoints`.
```

### 4. Vague Validation Criteria

**Problem**: Validation section says "check if output is correct" without specifying how.

**Why it happens**: Creator doesn't think through actual testing methodology.

**Solution**: Every validation must specify: input, expected output, comparison method, and pass/fail criteria.

**Example**:
```json
// ❌ Wrong - vague validation
{
  "test_cases": [
    {
      "name": "Basic test",
      "input": "test data",
      "expected_output": "correct result"
    }
  ]
}

// ✅ Correct - specific validation
{
  "test_cases": [
    {
      "name": "Valid SQL query detection",
      "input": "SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE active = true",
      "expected_output": {
        "valid": true,
        "dialect": "postgresql",
        "tables": ["users"],
        "warnings": []
      },
      "validation_method": "exact_match",
      "tolerance": {
        "ignore_whitespace": true,
        "case_sensitive": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Missing Tier Justification

**Problem**: Agent uses tier_3_optional sections but is marked as "simple" complexity.

**Why it happens**: Creator adds sections without considering whether they're actually needed for the agent's complexity level.

**Solution**: Match complexity to sections used. Simple agents should only have tier_1_core. Standard agents add tier_2. Complex agents may need tier_3.

### 9. Penalizing Empty Dependencies for LLM Agents

**Problem**: Flagging empty `packages: []` array as incomplete when the agent is LLM-based and does text analysis only.

**Why it happens**: Assumption that all agents require code packages, without considering that LLM-based agents doing text analysis need no external dependencies.

**Solution**: Understand the agent type before validating dependencies:
- **LLM/text-based agents**: Empty packages array is correct (e.g., SQL grading by text comparison)
- **Code-based agents**: Should list packages with versions
- **Hybrid agents**: May list optional packages for enhanced features

**Example**:
```json
// ✅ Correct for LLM text analysis agent
"dependencies": {
  "packages": [],  // No code execution needed
  "files": ["answer_key.sql"],
  "note": "LLM-based text analysis, no external packages required"
}

// ✅ Correct for Python implementation
"dependencies": {
  "packages": [
    "pandas>=2.0.0",
    "sqlparse>=0.4.0"
  ],
  "files": ["answer_key.sql"]
}
```

**Validation approach**: Note empty packages as informational, not a penalty. Check that dependencies section exists and files are listed appropriately.

## Examples (core)

### Example 1: Validating a Simple Agent

**Scenario**: Checking a newly created SQL query validator agent (simple complexity)

**Input**:
```json
{
  "agent_md_path": "sql_validator.md",
  "agent_json_path": "sql_validator.json",
  "strict_mode": false
}
```

**Approach**: QC agent loads both files, checks against `make_agent_qc.json` validation rules for simple agents (tier_1_core only)

**Output**:
```json
{
  "overall_score": 85,
  "status": "NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT",
  "dimension_scores": {
    "completeness": 95,
    "specificity": 70,
    "cleanup": 90,
    "consistency": 85,
    "examples": 75,
    "validation": 90,
    "dependencies": 100,
    "documentation": 80
  },
  "critical_issues": [
    {
      "dimension": "specificity",
      "severity": "medium",
      "issue": "Generic placeholder '[SQL dialect]' found in io_contract.inputs",
      "location": "sql_validator.json:134",
      "recommendation": "Specify supported SQL dialects explicitly (e.g., 'postgresql|mysql|sqlite')"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Add concrete SQL examples in Examples section",
    "Specify PostgreSQL version in dependencies",
    "Remove empty 'common_patterns' section (tier_3_optional not needed for simple agent)"
  ]
}
```

**Code**: See `make_agent_qc.json` → `validation.test_cases` for complete test suite

### Example 2: Complex Agent Validation

**Scenario**: Validating a multi-agent orchestrator (complex)

**Approach**: QC checks tier_1, tier_2, and tier_3 sections are appropriately used and complete. Validates cross-references exist.

**Code**: See `make_agent_qc.json` → `validation_rules.complex_agent_requirements`

### Example 3: CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**Scenario**: Automated agent validation in GitHub Actions

**Approach**: QC runs in strict mode, fails build if score < 80 or critical issues exist

**Code**: See `make_agent_qc.json` → `operational_guidance.ci_integration`

---

## Validation and Testing (core)

### Quick Validation
1. Run QC on a known-good agent: `qc.validate_agent("reference_agent.md", "reference_agent.json")`
2. Verify score is 95+ with no critical issues
3. Test with a deliberately broken agent to ensure detection works

### Comprehensive Validation
For detailed validation procedures, see `make_agent_qc.json` → `validation` section.

The validation section includes:
- Pre-run checklist (QC agent dependencies, reference templates)
- Post-run checklist (report format, score calculations, issue detection)
- Success criteria (score ranges, issue counts)
- Test cases covering all 8 quality dimensions
- Tolerance levels for different agent complexities

### Quality Dimensions Explained

**13 Quality Dimensions** (see JSON for scoring rubrics):

1. **Completeness**: All tier_1_core sections present and filled
2. **Specificity**: Content is agent-specific, not generic templates — includes optional sections when present
3. **Cleanup**: Unused optional sections removed; present optional sections have real content
4. **Consistency**: MD and JSON files align, no contradictions — includes companion sync check
5. **Examples**: Concrete, runnable examples with real data
6. **Validation**: Actionable test cases with clear pass/fail criteria
7. **Dependencies**: All dependencies explicitly listed and versioned
8. **Documentation**: Clear mission, principles, and usage instructions
9. **LLM Parameter Completeness**: For llm_agent type — tool_choice, response_format, disable_parallel_tool_use, mcp_servers, and strict present
10. **MD/JSON Companion Sync**: Every JSON known_failure, guardrail, and best_practice entry has corresponding MD narrative
11. **Pitfall/Lesson Separation**: Agent design mistakes in Pitfalls; external system quirks in External System Lessons — not mixed
12. **Graceful Degradation Coverage**: Agents with optional tools document fallback behavior in error_handling.fallbacks and system prompt
13. **Autonomy Guidance**: Workflow agents (those with multi-step loops or API writes) document propose-vs-execute behavior in system prompt or constraints

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run QC test suite
pytest test_agent_qc.py -v

# Test against reference agents
python test_qc_on_references.py --suite comprehensive
```

## Operational Guidance

### When to Use This QC Agent

**Use for**:
- All newly created agents before first deployment
- Agent updates that modify structure or core sections
- Automated CI/CD quality gates
- Pre-merge validation in pull requests
- Periodic audits of existing agent quality

**Don't use for**:
- Validating non-agent documentation
- Checking implementation code (only validates MD/JSON structure)
- Real-time development feedback (too heavyweight)

### Best Practices

1. **Run early and often**: Validate during development, not just before deployment
2. **Use non-strict mode during development**: Strict mode for CI/CD only
3. **Fix critical issues first**: Focus on critical/high severity before medium/low
4. **Iterate on specificity**: First pass often flags generic content
5. **Keep reference agents**: Maintain 100-scoring agents as examples

### Scoring Interpretation

- **95-100**: Excellent, ready for production
- **85-94**: Good, minor improvements needed
- **70-84**: Needs improvement, address recommendations
- **Below 70**: Significant issues, major revision required

### Alternatives

- **Manual review**: Use checklist from JSON for human review
- **Linting tools**: For syntax validation only (doesn't check semantics)
- **Peer review**: Complements automated QC, doesn't replace it
