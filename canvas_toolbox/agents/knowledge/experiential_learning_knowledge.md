Used by: `canvas_course_expert.md` (audit framework) — supplies the brain-aligned **sequencing principle** that determines *how* phases of learning should be delivered.

## The Core Claim

Traditional higher education sequences instruction as **explanation first, experience second**. Neuroscience research consistently shows the opposite: the brain forms durable neural pathways when learners interact with problems, experiment, receive feedback, and reflect — *and then* receive formal explanation.

> When experience comes first, explanation sticks. When learners act before they abstract, understanding deepens.

---

## The Brain-Aligned Sequence

```
Experience → Observation → Discussion → Explanation → Theory
```

This sequence is the operative inversion. Compare to traditional delivery:

| Traditional | Brain-aligned |
|---|---|
| Theory → Worked example → Practice → Apply | Experience → Observe → Discuss → Explain → Formalize |
| Activates language and short-term memory | Activates sensory, motor, decision-making, **and** emotional regions |
| Memorized for assessment, quickly forgotten | Anchored to lived cognitive experience |

The point is not that theory is unnecessary. It is that theory *sticks* only when the brain has prior experience to attach it to.

## Why Explanation-First Models Struggle

Aswad identifies this as **instructional design failure**, not student failure:

> Students may "know" a formula, a programming syntax or a security concept, yet struggle to apply it in unfamiliar or real-world contexts. The issue is not student ability, but instructional design.

Explanation-first delivery produces **surface learning** that fails the transfer test (Hattie's Phase 3). The transfer gap is structural — it lives in the sequence of delivery, not in the learner.

---

## Learning Precedes Language

A central neuroscience claim with direct design implications:

> Humans — from early childhood onward — grasp cause and effect, risk, patterns and systems long before they can formally articulate them. Explanation and terminology are most effective when they arrive after learners have already encountered a concept in action.

**Design implication:** module overviews, vocabulary lists, formal definitions, and frameworks should follow — not precede — student encounter with the phenomenon. The dominant LMS pattern (overview → reading → quiz) inverts this.

## Multi-Region Neural Activation

Experiential learning engages the brain more broadly than lecture:

| Mode | Brain regions activated |
|---|---|
| Lecture / reading | Language, short-term memory |
| Experiential | Sensory processing, motor control, decision-making, emotional engagement |

This expands on CLT's dual-channel theory. CLT says auditory and visual channels don't compete; experiential learning says **multi-region activation** strengthens schema formation across more pathways. Each additional region engaged is another retrieval cue.

Connection to Wilson (Three Domains): mixing cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains in one lesson produces "more neural networks and pathways thus aiding retention and recall." Same claim from a different framing.

## Domain-Specific Applications (Direct Relevance to BYUI IT/DS Courses)

Aswad calls out three disciplines explicitly. All three map directly to courses in this repo:

| Discipline | Brain-aligned approach |
|---|---|
| **Programming** | Start by making systems work, debugging behavior, observing outcomes — *then* name constructs (loops, variables, classes). |
| **Cybersecurity** | Experience simulated breaches, misconfigurations, mitigations — *then* study formal threat models. |
| **Artificial Intelligence** | Train simple models, observe bias and data dependency — *then* study the theory behind machine learning. |
| **Data Warehousing / SQL** *(extrapolation)* | Build a working pipeline against real data, observe what breaks — *then* introduce normalization theory and dimensional modeling. |

The unifying principle: **competence emerges from interaction, not exposition.**

## The Educator Role Shift

The brain-aligned model requires educators to move from primary transmitters of information to **designers of learning experiences**. Their expertise is expressed through:

1. **Structuring meaningful challenges** — problems worth solving, not exercises with known answers
2. **Curating environments for safe experimentation** — sandboxes, simulations, low-stakes failure
3. **Guiding reflection and conceptualisation** — pulling explicit understanding from implicit experience
4. **Connecting experience to disciplinary frameworks** — naming what students have already encountered

This is the same shift Designer Thinking describes — content as tool, not destination — with the neural rationale attached.

## Practical Steps for Course Redesign

Aswad's five institutional steps. Each maps to a Canvas-level audit indicator:

| Step | Canvas indicator |
|---|---|
| Introduce experiential components before formal theory | Module starts with reading/lecture page → flag; module starts with simulation/lab/scenario → pass |
| Embed simulation and problem-based learning early | Sprint 1 / Week 1 has only readings → flag; has hands-on artifact → pass |
| Design assessments that reward application, not recall | All assessments are multiple choice / fill-in → flag; project / build / case-analysis → pass |
| Invest in faculty development focused on learning design | (Outside Canvas scope, but informs designer thinking) |
| Align curricula with real-world systems and uncertainty | Assignments use canned data with single right answers → flag; assignments use messy/real data → pass |

## Canvas Audit Indicators

### Experience-first sequencing

| Signal | What it indicates |
|---|---|
| Module starts with a long reading or lecture before any activity | Explanation-first inversion — flag |
| Vocabulary / framework introduced before students encounter the phenomenon | Learning-precedes-language violation — flag |
| First assignment is a quiz on terminology | Surface-only assessment — flag |
| Module opens with a problem, simulation, or build → reading/explanation comes after | Brain-aligned — pass |
| Theory is positioned as "how to explain what you just observed" | Brain-aligned — pass |

### Multi-region engagement

| Signal | What it indicates |
|---|---|
| Module is text-only (read → quiz → next) | Single-region activation — flag |
| Module pairs reading with hands-on build, discussion, or artifact creation | Multi-region — pass |
| Reflection prompts ask students to connect experience to concept | Strengthens consolidation — pass |
| Activities require decision-making under uncertainty (not just procedure execution) | Engages prefrontal/decision-making circuits — pass |

### Educator-as-designer signals

| Signal | What it indicates |
|---|---|
| Instructions read as "follow these steps to get the right answer" | Transmission mode — flag |
| Instructions read as "here is the situation, here are constraints, design a response" | Designer mode — pass |
| Rubrics reward correct procedure execution | Transmission mode — flag |
| Rubrics reward sound judgment under ambiguity | Designer mode — pass |

## Tag Used in Audit Output

Add a `sequencing` field to relevant audit issues:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `experience_first` | Module/item delivers experience before explanation — pass |
| `explanation_first` | Module/item delivers explanation before any experience — flag |
| `not_applicable` | Sequencing not relevant (e.g., reference page) |

Pair with the existing tags (`hattie_phase`, `cognitive_load_type`, `learning_domain`) to give the auditor a four-axis diagnosis: *which phase* is *which load type* affecting *which domain*, delivered in *which sequence*.

---

## Quick Reference for Auditors

When evaluating any module or sequence, ask:

1. **What encounters the student first** — a phenomenon to explore, or a definition to memorize?
2. **Is theory a starting point or a tool** — does it open the module, or does it arrive after observation?
3. **Where is the first decision the student must make?** — early (engaging decision-making circuits) or only at the final assessment?
4. **What regions does this module activate?** — only language/memory (read + quiz), or multi-region (read + build + discuss + reflect)?
5. **What does the rubric reward?** — correct execution of a known procedure, or sound judgment under ambiguity?

A "no" or "explanation-first" answer is a brain-alignment defect. The fix is rarely "add more content" — it is usually **re-sequencing what's already there**.

## The Bottom Line

> The future of effective higher education lies not in saying more, but in designing better experiences for students to learn from.

Auditing a course only against Hattie or CLT can score it well even when delivery is fundamentally inverted. Experiential learning supplies the missing diagnostic: *is the sequence brain-aligned, or is it transmission dressed up as instruction?*
