# AGENTS.md

Project context for AI coding tools. This file is auto-loaded by Antigravity, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Aider, and others. Claude Code reads it as a fallback when no `CLAUDE.md` is present.

> If you create a personal `CLAUDE.md` for local notes, start it with `@AGENTS.md` so this file stays loaded too.

## What This Is

A Canvas LMS course management toolkit. It mirrors a live Canvas course into a local `course/` folder, audits structure against pedagogical frameworks, and applies instructor-approved changes via the Canvas REST API. Three courses can be managed in parallel: source (working), master (template), and blueprint (semester rollout).

Universal toolkit — works with any Canvas institution. Originally built for BYU-Idaho but designed to be institution-agnostic.

## Course Architecture

| Variable | Course ID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CANVAS_COURSE_ID` | [your ID] | Source / working course — `course/` mirrors this |
| `MASTER_COURSE_ID` | [your ID] | Master template — receives pushes from source via `course_mirror.py` |
| `BLUEPRINT_COURSE_ID` | [your ID] | Canvas Blueprint — synced from master; new semester sections cloned from this |

Source → Master → Blueprint is the content flow. Never reverse this direction. If you only have one course, set only `CANVAS_COURSE_ID` and ignore the master/blueprint tools.

## Setup

See `agents/canvas_new_course_setup.md` for a full walkthrough. Quick path:

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — add CANVAS_API_TOKEN, CANVAS_BASE_URL, CANVAS_COURSE_ID,
#              MASTER_COURSE_ID, BLUEPRINT_COURSE_ID

uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --init           # pull source course into course/
uv run python tools/blueprint_sync.py --pull        # mirror blueprint + build mapping (if using)
uv run python tools/course_mirror.py --pull         # map master item IDs (if using)
```

**API token**: Canvas → Account → Settings → Approved Integrations → New Access Token. Requires instructor or admin role on all courses you plan to write to.

## Commands

```bash
# Source course (CANVAS_COURSE_ID)
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --pull                        # Canvas → course/
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --pull --quiet                # suppress per-file output
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --status                      # show local changes not yet pushed
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --push                        # push all changes to Canvas
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --push "[module-slug]"        # push one module only
uv run python tools/canvas_sync.py --push syllabus               # push syllabus only

# Blueprint (master → BLUEPRINT_COURSE_ID)
uv run python tools/blueprint_sync.py --pull                     # full init + build mapping
uv run python tools/blueprint_sync.py --push                     # sync master → blueprint
uv run python tools/blueprint_sync.py --status                   # mapping + date coverage

# Master (source → MASTER_COURSE_ID)
uv run python tools/course_mirror.py --pull                      # map master item IDs
uv run python tools/course_mirror.py --push                      # push course/ → master

# Quality check — run after every push
uv run python tools/course_quality_check.py                      # check source course
uv run python tools/course_quality_check.py --master             # check master
uv run python tools/course_quality_check.py --blueprint          # check blueprint
uv run python tools/course_quality_check.py --all                # all three → quality_report.md
uv run python tools/course_quality_check.py --all --fix          # auto-fix duplicates

# Classic quiz questions
uv run python tools/canvas_quiz_questions.py --push <file.questions.json>   # idempotent
uv run python tools/canvas_quiz_questions.py --list <file.questions.json>
uv run python tools/canvas_quiz_questions.py --clear <file.questions.json>

# Smoke test (no credentials needed)
uv run python tools/canvas_api_tool.py --test
```

## Agents

Each agent in `agents/` is a pair of files: a `.md` guide (mission, principles, pitfalls) and a `.json` (structured data, API patterns, mappings). Load both when invoking the agent.

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `canvas_course_expert` | Audit course content against the 7-framework instructional-design stack (CLT, Hattie, Three Domains, Taxonomy Explorer, Experiential Learning, Designer Thinking, Toyota A3) |
| `canvas_content_sync` | Push page/assignment content changes to Canvas |
| `canvas_blueprint_sync` | Sync master → blueprint including dates, completion requirements, prerequisites |
| `canvas_schedule_auditor` | Rule-based date audit — propose-before-execute, with institution-aware rules |
| `canvas_semester_setup` | Roll due dates forward for a new semester given a Week 1 start date |
| `canvas_new_course_setup` | First-time setup walkthrough for a new course fork |
| `make_agent` | Template for creating new agents in this system |
| `make_agent_qc` | Validate a new agent against make_agent standards |

For framework theory and the routing rules between them, see [`agents/knowledge/README.md`](agents/knowledge/README.md).

## Sync Limitations

**This is not git.** No commit history, no branching, no conflict detection.

- Local edits → Canvas: `--status` → `--push` → `--pull --quiet`
- Canvas-side edit → local: `--pull` (answer `y` to accept Canvas, discard local)
- **NewQuiz/ExternalTool** items cannot be pushed via REST API — manage in Canvas UI. The sync scripts warn when a module contains only these types (the module shell syncs but lands empty).

## Critical Invariants

1. **Edit `course/` locally first.** Canvas is the sync target, not the source.
2. **Canvas IDs are course-specific.** The same assignment has a different ID in every course and cloned section. Match content across courses by title, never by ID.
3. **Adding content requires two steps: course + module.** An assignment/quiz/page not linked as a module item is invisible to students. Run `course_quality_check.py` after every push.
4. **Completion requirements enable the prerequisite chain.** Every item in every locked module must have `must_submit` (assignments/quizzes) or `must_view` (pages/tools) set, or the module lock silently stops enforcing.
5. **Confirm scope before any write.** Always verify the target course ID before pushing. Master, blueprint, and source are different courses with different IDs.
6. **`request_confirmation()` must return `approved=true` before any Canvas write.** All audit agents enforce this for any create/update/delete operation.

## Canvas API Gotchas

- **Module prerequisites**: form-encoded `data={"module[prerequisite_module_ids][]": id}` — JSON payload returns 200 but silently does nothing
- **Module published state**: `data={"module[workflow_state]": "active"|"unpublished"}` (form-encoded)
- **Semester due date updates**: always send `lock_at: null, unlock_at: null` alongside `due_at` — reading quizzes retain prior-semester availability windows that cause 400 errors if not cleared
- **late_policy PATCH**: 403 for instructor tokens — set manually in Canvas Settings → Gradebook or use admin token
- **Classic quiz points**: may show 0 after question push — fix with `PUT /quizzes/:id {"quiz": {"points_possible": N}}`
- **Quiz IDs**: a classic quiz has both a `quiz_id` (used by module items) and an underlying `assignment_id` (used by `PUT /assignments/:id` for due dates)
- **Discussions use a different due date field**: `todo_date` in `PUT /discussion_topics/:id`, not `due_at`

## Quality Check Workflow

Run after every push to any course:

```bash
uv run python tools/course_quality_check.py --all
```

Report categories:
- **Auto-fixable** (`--fix`): duplicate assignment groups, assignments, quizzes, module items; orphaned duplicates
- **Manual review**: published items not in any module, empty modules, dates outside the course window, missing course dates

`quality_report.md` at repo root is the human-readable output. Per-course JSON in `.canvas/quality_report_*.json` is machine-readable for agents.

## Course-Specific Notes

<!-- Add per-institution notes here: module/sprint structure, grading model, competency thresholds, timezone, known Canvas quirks. Or create a personal CLAUDE.md (gitignored) and put them there. -->

## Roadmap

The following items are planned next for this toolkit. Snapshot of the agreed direction toward making canvas_toolbox installable as a cross-tool deployable skill across universities and AI tools.

1. **Convert `canvas_course_expert` → `.agents/skills/canvas-audit/`** — first deployable skill following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) standard. Parameterize for non-BYUI institutions (institution name, course ID env vars, audit framework subset). Test discovery in Antigravity, VS Code Copilot, and Claude Code.
2. **Capture conversion pattern as `agents/deploy_agent.md`** — template for transforming a `make_agent`-produced spec into a `.agents/skills/<name>/` package. Sibling to `make_agent.md` (design-time) and `make_agent_qc.md` (validation).
3. **Convert `canvas_schedule_auditor` using the new template** — validates `deploy_agent.md` on a different agent shape. Confirms the template generalizes.
4. **Document per-tool quickstart in README** — "Using Claude Code? Just works. Antigravity? Just works. VS Code Copilot? Flip `chat.useAgentsMdFile: true` once. Cursor? Just works."

Vision: another university clones this repo, opens it in whatever AI coding tool they use, and the canvas-audit capability is auto-discovered by their AI — zero install friction beyond clone-and-open.
